# SOC-Analyst-Project

The project aims to develop a software solution called "Dynamic SOC Training Simulator," providing an immersive, real-time training environment for aspiring SOC analysts. This tool will simulate various network scenarios and cyber threats, allowing users to engage with and respond to them as they would in a real SOC.
